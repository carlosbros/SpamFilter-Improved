=== Spam Filter Improved README ===
===================================

Project in Python that builds upon my other Spam Filter project and 
improves it, achieving over 99% accuracy in spam email detection.

The original spam filter only took into account unigram tokens as words.
This improved version also uses features like bigrams, length of words and
whether a token is a digit. The Improvement Report gives more information
on additional features and experiments done.
